Multi-Disease Prediction System

📌 Project Overview

The Multi-Disease Prediction System is a machine learning–based web application that predicts the likelihood of multiple diseases using both structured medical data and skin image classification.
The system helps in early detection, supports quick medical insights, and demonstrates the integration of machine learning with a web interface.
